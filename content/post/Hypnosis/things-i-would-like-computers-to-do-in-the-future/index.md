Computers can do a lot of things right now, but they still can’t do everything. Here’s just a few things I would like to see them do someday:

## Determine which way you are wearing your headphones and adjust accordingly

For 549$, it’s shocking AirPods Max isn’t capable of determining how you’re wearing them.

## Perform small actions with just a few sentences

They keep pushing AI everywhere, but it still doesn’t do anything useful aside from give you plausible sounding information shaped sentences you have to really look at to understand if they’re true. When is the day coming that I can ask the computer to perform a multitude of actions on my behalf?

## Be designed in ways that aren’t confusing

This one is mostly a free pass. We all know it can’t happen.

## Find ways to block out articles online that are just speculation

There are some pretty slow days at some newsroom. So the only real thing left to do is write about something that:

- Hasn’t happened

- Is about to happen, but with little known information

- Isn’t actually going to happen

All of them have one thing in common, they’re designed solely to prey on your endless desire for knowledge fill up an article capable of generating ad revenue.

I’ve seen articles that, while trying to find the answer to a question, just waste 3 paragraphs describing the entire history of a thing. Only to end with “what you are trying to do with the thing isn’t possible”

We already have SponsorBlock, so what’s the holdup with it?

## Officially listening to Nintendo soundtracks in my preferred music app

A couple months ago, Nintendo released… A separate music app… to Nintendo switch online subscribers.

While the app does offer some things that rationalize the creation of yet another app on your phone, like hiding spoilers, or setting up extended loops of a specific song, it’s still frustrating that the most Nintendo fans have gotten is a few official CD’s as Japanese imports or now defunct Nintendo power mail orders.

## Have a dedicated Wiki Reader app

Many Wiki’s run on MediaWiki. And while some of them might be modified to the point that this would be difficult. There’s still a whole lot more knowledge out there than just on Wikipedia. So why can’t we have one app to view them all? Go from everything in the Nintendo Independent Wiki Alliance, to the Minecraft Wiki, and everywhere else. It would probably be the biggest compendium of knowledge contained in a piece of software ever.

## Go back to having more dedicated devices rather than just a single rectangular slab

I think the world would benefit again from having the iPod, Palm, and other consumer electronics now typically considered obsolete now because of the all mighty “smartphone”.

Sure, the world would benefit from spending less on frivolous things, but some also just don’t need all the extra things. Of course, society tilts its head whenever you don’t want something like that.

But in an era where your podcast app can be sunset in favor of wrapping it up with the place you listen to music (See Google Podcasts). It’s nice to have things that don’t change, at least not very much. Not to mention it’s nice to have things that are simple for the elderly that just don’t care if they can access the worlds infomation from their table whenever they like. They’ll still turn to the 5 o’clock news on their TV for that limited digest they’ve been conditioned.

While many TV’s have always had the ability to hook up to a cable or antenna for TV, they’ve usually just been a mere vessel for connecting whatever you please. Now, they all try to be all in one entertainment stations that attempt to replace all the other boxes you would use. Extending all the way onto the remote itself.

I could be wrong about this, but I have a feeling that Apple‘s goal for the iPhone from the start was to replace the iPod . The Music app was even initially called “iPod” then.

Anyway, that’s just a quick list of all my complaints. Not sure how many of these will actually happen in the future.￼￼
