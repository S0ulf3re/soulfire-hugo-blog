There’s a lot of places on the net, and not all of them are cool. Some of them are really big and are bloated with ads and everything, but some of them are smaller, but also have a lot of neat things to check out and a lot of things that you can sink your time into. Here’s just a few of them:

## [BetaWiki](http://betawiki.net)

BetaWiki is a wiki dedicated to documenting the history of various software, with a heavy focus on Microsoft Windows. A solid majority of the content on that site is so entrenched in incredibly technical and arcane knowledge that I would likely never completely understand. But it’s fun to click around on random pages and see what Windows might have looked like at one point. Even if it looks exactly the same as the other builds. Also, sometimes, you encounter cool stuff like this:

## [Shadowlord Inc.](https://www.shadowlordinc.com)

Like transformation content? Well you might be interested in Shadowlord Inc. a website dedicated to documenting transformation sequences across animated and live action shows and other multimedia￼.

Founded in 1999, (with a webpage design to match), and monthly updates to the site, there’s quite a bit to explore. And I really gotta hand it off to them for making 90s web design look good. You just can’t go wrong with that Gothic logo.

## [The Big Cartoon Wiki](http://bigcartoon.org)

If perhaps transformation isn’t your cup of tea, perhaps you might find inflation to be a little more interesting. And we are not talking about the economy either, we’re talking about cartoons.

With [over 78 GB](http://bigcartoon.org/wiki/Special:MediaStatistics) worth of images at the time of writing, after initially, beginning as a Tumblr blog, it’s involved into a wiki dedicated to documenting every inflation or weight gain sequence found in cartoons and cartoons alone.
