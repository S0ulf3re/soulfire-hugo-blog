I've got to admit, Flipnote is a pretty cool application. Well, it's not one that I actively grew up using. Or at the very least, one that I actively engaged with for art, I've still watched a ton of Flipnotes over the years. And recently, I've started enjoying a lot of the major Flipnote creators like [raxdflipnote](https://www.youtube.com/@raxdflipnote) and [Zane Little](https://www.youtube.com/@ZaneLittle). Perhaps it's just because of how distracted I am anymore. But they're still a very good distraction, regardless.

Animation is pretty hard, and doing it on a very small screen seems even harder. Especially doing it in an application that lacks a lot of the big-time animation features that most professional grade apps have. Such as Keyframes, Shape Tweens, among a lot of other things that I probably missed when I observed Adobe anime in a middle school STEM class.

This was probably just filler so that I could feel a sense of justification migrating my blog. But I will call it content regardless.
