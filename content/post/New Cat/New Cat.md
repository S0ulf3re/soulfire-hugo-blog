The other day, we got a new cat. One of our older cats, Claire, had to be euthanized due to her having a form of bone cancer.

I personally didn’t quite want a new cat, mainly because I wanted to be able to give the multiple animals that we already do have a nicer place to live. But I will admit, the little guy is a cutie. We don’t quite have a name yet for him. But it might be something related to Mike or Jasper.
